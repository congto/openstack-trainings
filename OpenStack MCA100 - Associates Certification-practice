    1) ______________ are created from templates as it regards to Heat.

    Correct
    Correct answer

    Stacks
    Explanation

    Stacks are created from templates

    2) What is the best definition of a 'stateful' service?

    Correct
    Correct answer

    One where subsequent requests to the service depend on the results of the first request. They are more difficult to manage because a single action involves more than one request, simply providing additional instances and load balancing will not work.
    Explanation

    Stateless vs. Stateful services A stateless service is one that provides a response after your request, and then requires no further attention. To make a stateless service highly available, you need to provide redundant instances and load balance them. OpenStack services that are stateless include nova-api, nova-conductor, glance-api, keystone-api, neutron-api and nova-scheduler. A stateful service is one where subsequent requests to the service depend on the results of the first request. Stateful services are more difficult to manage because a single action typically involves more than one request, so simply providing additional instances and load balancing will not solve the problem. For example, if the Horizon user interface reset itself every time you went to a new page, it wouldn't be very useful. OpenStack services that are stateful include the OpenStack database and message queue. Making stateful services highly available can depend on whether you choose an active/passive or active/active configuration.

    17) It is best practice to access the underlying database directly for polling data from Ceilometer.

    Correct
    Correct answer

    False
    Explanation

    API Service If the collected data from polling and notification agents are stored in supported database(s), it is possible that the schema of these database(s) may evolve over time. For this reason, we offer a REST API and recommend that you access the collected data via the API rather than by accessing the underlying database directly.

    18) There are many types of cloud services. Some offer Software as a Service, Platform as a Service, Software defined networking, and Infrastructure as a Service. Which of these different types of "cloud" services defines OpenStack?

    26) The Ceilometer projects created two methods to collect data:

    Correct
    Correct answer

    bus Listener agent , polling agents
    Explanation

    Two methods to collect data: 1) Bus Listener agent - which takes events generated on the notification bus and transforms them into Ceilometer samples. This is the preferred method of data collection. If you are working on some OpenStack related project and are using the Oslo library, you are kindly invited to come and talk to one of the project members to learn how you could quickly add instrumentation for your project. 2) Polling agents, which is the less preferred method, will poll some API or other tool to collect information at a regular interval. Where the option exists to gather the same data by consuming notifications, then the polling approach is less preferred due to the load it can impose on the API services.

    27) The most commonly used and supported hypervisor used for OpenStack is:

    Correct
    Correct answer

    KVM

    28) When creating an instance in the CLI, what would the added benefit be to add an SSH key to our instance at boot time? What is the actual 'benefit'?

    Correct
    Correct answer

    Be able to access our VM without the need to provide a password via SSH
    Explanation

    The benefit of adding an SSH key to our instance at boot time is that we can then access our VM without the need to enter a password. Using VNC console access on our instance in OpenStack does not play a part with SSH keys. Adding encryption with an SSH pair is not the benefit here, it is the need for no password.

    29) Which service models does cloud computing provide?

    Correct
    Correct answer

    SaaS, PaaS, IaaS

    55) What is the best definition of a 'stateless' service?

    Correct
    Correct answer

    One that provides a response after your request, and then requires no further attention. To make the service highly available, you need to provide redundant instances and load balance them.
